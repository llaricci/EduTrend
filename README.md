# EduTrend

EduTrend is an educational software designed to receive inputs made by a
school staff member on to an app or device, record the
frequency and timing of these inputs, and analyze trends based
on the collected data and other relevant external factors. The
main goal of the software is to provide valuable insights for
educators and administrators to enhance the learning experience
of the students by identifying patterns and making data-driven
decisions.
